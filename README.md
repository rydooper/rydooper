# RydoopersRepo
Howdy! I'm <b>Ryder Franklin</b> and this is my Github! <br>
Fun tibits:
- I'm currently a <b>Third Year Computer Science</b> student at Nottingham Trent University (NTU).
- I also work with NTU's School of Architecture, Design and the Built Environment as a research assistant!
- I use <b>he/him</b> pronouns.
- I love cats!

My current coding projects are:
- a python voice assistant called Artie
- a discord bot that pulls data on funkos from the Funko Europe website (this may be extended to further websites in the future)
- a webscraper for articles on the BBC (my final year project, very exciting)
- a "bridge viewer" which interprets RVT files and displays them, using Autodesk Forge's API

<br>
Once these projects are complete, the repos will be made public! I'm currently learning lots of webscraping using Selenium.
<br>

My other, past projects you may be interested in:

- my service-centric and cloud computing coursework from 2021 -> [a springboot application that utilises REST API services](https://github.com/rydooper/SCC_Coursework)
- [my jupyter notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/ryderfranklin/notebooks) 
- my machine learning coursework from 2020 -> [a program that predicts a developers salary (also on jupyter notebook)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryderfranklin/machine-learning-coursework-2021/notebook)
<br>

My archived projects that will be completed in the future but, as of right now, aren't finished:
- a twitter bot called kingofthecloudsbot (<b> archived </b>) <- this one requires more knowledge of hosting twitter bots on heroku to complete
- a discord translater bot (<b> archived </b>) <- this one needs time to implement the translation features
