# RydoopersRepo
Howdy! I'm <b>Ryder Franklin</b> and this is my Github! <br>
Fun tibits:
- I graduated from NTU in June of 2022!
- I use <b>he/him</b> pronouns.
- I love cats!

My current coding projects are:
- a C# based RPG game with minigames and a focus on storylines!
- a python voice assistant called Artie
<br>
Once these projects are complete, the repos will be made public! I'm currently learning C# through this game creation process which is exciting as I've not actually used C# before this :p

<br><br>
My other, past projects you may be interested in:

- my final year project from 2021-22 -> [a webscraper for articles on the BBC](https://github.com/rydooper/FYPCode) -> this is unlikely to have updates due to legal issues with using data from BBC's website. as such, it must remain as an academic/"proof of concept" style project
  
- my service-centric and cloud computing coursework from 2021 -> [a springboot application that utilises REST API services](https://github.com/rydooper/SCC_Coursework)
  
- my machine learning coursework from 2020 -> [a program that predicts a developers salary (found on jupyter notebook)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryderfranklin/machine-learning-coursework-2021/notebook)
