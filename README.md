# RydoopersRepo
Howdy! I'm <b>Ryder Franklin</b> and this is my Github! <br>
Fun tibits:
- I'm currently a <b>Third Year Computer Science</b> student at Nottingham Trent University (NTU).
- I use <b>he/him</b> pronouns.
- I love cats!

My current coding projects are:
- a twitter bot called kingofthecloudsbot 
- a python voice assistant called Artie
- a program to predict a developer's salary, using machine learning!
<br>
Once these projects are complete, the repos will be made public! I am also in the process of learning React.
